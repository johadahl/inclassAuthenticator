# inclassAuthenticator
A tiny Android app that can encrypt a string into a sound signal and then broadcast this signal through the speakers. 
The signal is send on a inaudiable spectrum; about 18khz.

The app can also be put in listening mode. It will listen for a signal and once the signal is recieved it will decrypt it into a string.

Thus if two phones have the app, one can send strings in the inaudiable sound spectrum between eachother using only the phones speakers and microphones.
